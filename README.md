# bike_alerts
Uses Strava API, Google Sheets, and Pushover to issue alerts when I need to do bike maintenance. 

Runs via a daily github workflow. 

Currently just gives updates for chain waxing based on mileage, but I intend to add additional alerts such as tire replacement, cassette replacement, di2 charging etc. based on a combination of mileage, weather, and time.
